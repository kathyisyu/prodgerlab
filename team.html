					<p>Dr. Prodger is currently a Canada Research Chair and assistant professor at Western University in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. The goal of her work is to design new ways to prevent HIV transmission, which could have a significant impact on the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Her research is focused on understanding the interplay and communication between the penile microbiome and the human tissues, and how the relationship between bacteria and human cells can influence HIV.</p>

					<p>David obtained his PhD in Biochemistry from Western University in 2019. His work focused on applying mass spectrometry-based proteomics to diagnose infectious diseases in saliva, such as the Zika virus. David also holds a DDS degree and an MSc in periodontology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, where he studied the colonization of the oral cavity by non-indigenous species that cause nosocomial infections. In his current postdoc position, David is working on developing an organotypic foreskin model to understand how the interaction between the foreskin and the penile microbiome is associated with HIV susceptibility.</p>

					<p>Geoff is currently working on developing and characterizing an in-vitro foreskin model. He received an Honours BSc in Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Windsor (with great distinction). Geoff aspires to be a medical doctor in the future. Fun fact: Geoff can wiggle his ears. When Geoff isn't at the lab culturing infinite amounts of cells or unsuccessfully Western blotting, he is usually found trying new restaurants and cuisines, playing guitar, and forgetting to water his plants.</p>

					<p>Joyce (Zihan) Yang is a one-year clinical medicine international (visiting) student from West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University. She joined Prodger Lab since September 2019 and is working on a project about the susceptibility of foreskin tissue, grown in explant culture, to HIV-1 infection. This project involves virus propagation, virus quantification and in vitro tissue explant infection. She aims to gain knowledge of all of the viruses that she has propagated, and generate a qPCR standard curve as excellent as the one from the p24 ELISA. Fun fact: Joyce cannot draw blood despite the fact that sheâ€™s a medical school student (although we are all sure that she can).</p>

						</div>
					<p>Eric is a recent graduate of the BMSc (Hon. Spec. Microbiology and Immunology) program at Western and will be starting his MSc under Dr. Prodger's supervision this fall. Eric joined the Prodger Lab in 2019 went on to complete his 4th year honors thesis project, which examined the impact of antimicrobial on penile inflammation and HIV susceptibility in men. His main projects in the Prodger lab include the development of an automated deep-learning algorithm to analyze immunofluorescent microscopy images of mucosal tissues and the characterization of the latent HIV-1 reservoir using deep-sequencing techniques. Additionally, Eric is involved in the development of all PCR/sequencing-related protocols in the Prodger Lab. He is currently working with other lab members to develop qPCR assays to measure TLR expression in immortalized keratinocytes and to measure bacteria density in penile swabs. In the future, Eric hopes to become a clinician-scientist and improve the quality-of-care for patients affected by infectious diseases. Fun fact, Eric is a long-time Boston Celtics fan. If you can't find Eric in the lab, he's probably out playing pick-up basketball somewhere. </p>

					<h3>Spencer Yeung</h3>

					<p>Spencer earched his BMSc Honours Specialization in Physiology, MMASc Global Health Systems, and MSc Microbiology and Immunology at Western University. Spencer led the coordination of our lab's first clinical research study with Urologists in Toronto to collect foreskin tissues from adults undergoing male circumcision. These tissues were then used to optimize the ex vivo explant tissue model which can be used to assess the susceptibility of tissues to HIV. Our lab's vision is that this measured susceptibility can then be correlated with how a person's microbiome affects recruitment of immune cells to the foreskin tissue. In his work, to optimize the explant model, he competed viruses of different subtypes and measured their relative transmission efficiencies in both cervical and foreskin tissue. Fun fact: Spencer auditioned for the lead male role of Disney's live action remake of Mulan!</p>
